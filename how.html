					<h3>How to Play</h3>
					<p> To play the game select a color piece by clicking one of the circles in the top. Then click the position in the board
						you want to place that piece. You can only play one row at a time starting from the top. Your goal is to match the 
						random pattern	set up by the computer. After you set up your row, click the 'answer' cell in that row to get feedback.
						A red dot means a piece in the right spot, a white (hollow) dot means a correct colored piece but in the wrong location.</p>
						
						<p>For more details see the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)">Mastermind Wikipedia Page</a></p>
					
					<p>The application prototype was built by Ryan Sutcliffe and Matthew Saleh at NSCC.</p>
